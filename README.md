# Pokémon Frontend Demo

This project demonstrates three levels of sophistication in creating a Pokémon frontend demo using the PokéAPI.
Written as a single page application using React and Vite.

- **Bare**: A simple version with no styling, focusing on implementing the core requirements under time pressure.
- **Basic**: A version with basic styling, allowing for the demonstration of more advanced concepts with additional time.
- **Advanced**: A version with advanced styling and additional features, designed to be close to production-ready code.
